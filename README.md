# 🔐 Streamlit Login Examples

This repository contains **three examples of login systems built with Streamlit**:

1. **Simple Login** – Hardcoded username and password (for learning).
2. **SQLite Login** – Database authentication using SQLite.
3. **Google OAuth Login** – Sign in with Google using OAuth 2.0.

These examples are designed for learning purposes so you can gradually move from a basic login form to a real-world authentication system.
